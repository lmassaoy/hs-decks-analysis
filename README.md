# hs-decks-analysis
This project is an experience of data analysis using Streamlit to support us on the data exploration, reading data from decks built on https://www.hearthpwn.com/ and with help of the open API https://hearthstonejson.com/
The main dataset we'll be using here was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/romainvincent/history-of-hearthstone), so I'd to thanks the creator of this dataset to share it with us, allowing us to navigate and analyze 3 years of deck building.

Please enjoy :)
